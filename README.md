# FPL Zone

FPL Zone is a companion application developed for Fantasy Premier League managers which helps
them with their in-game strategies. It acts as a statistics hub where users can analyse player performances
through tables and data visualisations (graphs, charts, etc.).

# Technologies

The majority of data consumed by FPL Zone is fetched from the Premier League's official FPL API.
There is no documentation for this API but the endpoints can be viewed [here](https://cheatography.com/sertalpbilal/cheat-sheets/fpl-api-endpoints/).

React and Material UI were the core frameworks used to build the app.

A firebase realtime database was used to store user data.
